## Global Inflation Data Visualizations

**Mohammad - 100755461**

### Project Overview

This project utilizes the Global Inflation Data from Kaggle.com to offer insights into economic factors influencing global economies. By examining inflation rates across various countries, the visualizations aid in understanding the implications on investments and policy-making. These insights are crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

### Visualizations

- **Figure 1: Inflation Rate by Country (2008)**
  - A horizontal bar chart depicting inflation rates in countries with IMF codes starting with '1'. It categorizes inflation into types like Energy, Food, Headline, Official Core, and Producer Price Inflation. This visualization aids in comparing the inflation rates and understanding economic conditions across these nations.

- **Figure 2: Food Consumer Price Inflation Choropleth Map (2020)**
  - Uses a choropleth map to represent food consumer price inflation in countries with IMF codes starting with '5'. The map employs shades of red to indicate the magnitude of inflation rates, providing a visual representation of regional economic conditions.

- **Figures 3 & 4: Relationship Between Inflation Rate and GDP/GDP Per Capita (2021)**
  - Bubble charts that explore the relationship between Producer Price inflation rate and GDP or GDP per capita for countries with IMF codes starting with '1'. These visualizations highlight the economic stature and inflation rates through bubble size and color gradients, offering insights into how GDP levels correlate with inflation.

### Core Competencies Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Demonstrated the ability to transform complex datasets into comprehensible visual formats that facilitate easier interpretation and analysis of global economic trends.
- **Critical Thinking and Insight Generation:** Developed visualizations that not only depict data but also provide foundational insights for economic analysis, helping to identify trends, outliers, and correlations.

### Technologies Leveraged

- **Data Visualization Tools:** Employed advanced visualization tools to create dynamic and informative charts and maps that effectively communicate the intricacies of economic data.
- **Data Sources:** Utilized comprehensive datasets from Kaggle, which include detailed records of global inflation and GDP metrics across various years.

### Project Goals

- To provide a visual analysis of inflation trends worldwide, aiding stakeholders in understanding economic conditions and making informed decisions.
- To illustrate the impact of different economic variables on inflation, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of economic dynamics.
